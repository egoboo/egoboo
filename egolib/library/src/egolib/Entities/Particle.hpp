    *   There could be a possibility that a particle exists that was spawned by
    *   another particle, but has lost contact with its original spawner. For instance
    *   If an explosion particle bounces off of something with MISSILE_DEFLECT or
    *   MISSILE_REFLECT, which subsequently dies before the particle...
    *
    *   That is actually pretty far fetched, but at some point it might make sense to
    *   spawn particles just keeping track of the spawner (whether particle or character)
    *   and working backward to any potential owner using this function. ;)
