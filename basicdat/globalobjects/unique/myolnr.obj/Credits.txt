This is a very powerful legendary weapon, Myolnr.
It attacks even faster than a regular war hammer, and also does quite a bit of damage.
But you have to actually use it. If you go twenty seconds without using it, it KILLS YOU!
I was thinking this could be hidden somewhere in some... really secret place. Since it's 
really powerful; it's even better than a magical weapon. Plus, if you let some greedy monster 
pick it up and then run away from it... >8D

Anyway. The script was done by Zefz, although I've added a few revisions of my own.
Thor's voice was provided by Chainsaw and edited by Zefz.

Oh, and also, the lightning is set up right now for the default blueish-purplish-grayish
stuff, but I've provided some new red lightning that would be more fitting. If you have 
Egoboo 2.7, you can add them at the end of the particle file and change the numbers in the
particle files accordingly. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, don't worry about it. 
All it would change is the color of the electric stuff.
Oh, and apparently phong mapping has been changed in recent versions, so I've also provided 
an alternate texture. I like the way it's set up now much better, but there's not much I can
do about that, really. So if you're using a recent version you may want to change it; just 
rename "tris0" to something else, and rename "tris1" to "tris0."

Enjoy.
Enjoy dying.
MWAHAHAHA!

...No, seriously. It's a lot of fun.
