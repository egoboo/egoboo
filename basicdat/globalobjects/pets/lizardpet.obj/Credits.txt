This one is an interesting idea I had, inspired by the various lizard monsters and the mounting system in Nethack/SLASH'EM.
This model and skin set is intended to be used for reptilian pets, mounts, and monsters.
Based on the Gnewt from the old Zippy project.

armor.bmp provided for ease of editing (If you make a skin you can slap it on to create an "armored" version of your new skin.)
The armor is intended for mounts (there's a saddle on the salamander's back), but I was also thinking of allowing players to purchase armor for their pet lizards.

Todo:
- Create a smooth walking animation
- Scripting and data
- Create a pet armor shop event/object
