// This file tells the module which teams should ally with which teams.
// Only the first letter of a team name is used, and make sure it is
// capital.  N is predefined to be neutral.  If one team allies with another,
// but the other team does not reciprocate the alliance, then the first
// team can still be killed by the second.
